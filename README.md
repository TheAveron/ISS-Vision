#### Description

This site his my final project to the Harvard's CS50 course.

This is a website made in python 3.12 with Flask that shows the current position of the iss around the world and it future trajectory.

There is also some complementary informations, like the crew actually on board, the speed, the altitude, and a calculator of the next three passes near your location (needs you to allow acces to geolocation of course).
